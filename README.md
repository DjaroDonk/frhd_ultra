This module is still nigh impossible to use. It will straight up not launch if you try to use it as is, you have to edit some code for it to work. Furthermore, there is no documentation yet, just code. I came back to this code and had **no idea** what to do or how it worked, only after reading the documentation of the module this is based on did I understand it. 

---
However, I am working on (read: planning to at an unspecified moment in the future) port the changes from my private instance to the module itself, so it is at least usable. Documentation may be coming soon after that.

If you really want to use it, leave a comment so I know someone wants to use it, and I'll hurry up and make it usable more quickly.

That out of the way

I can finally write about the module. It lets you:
1. Procedurally generate tracks
2. Add text to tracks
3. It also contains an the entire frhd_tools library it is based on, so you can use complex mathematics and code to generate tracks
4. This is not a current use, but I am planning on maybe adding some decoration like trees and clouds that you  can just generate in with a single command (but that is still very far away)

It also lets you create tracks automatically without human interference, so you  can in theory generate a million tracks a day (although getting the coins to publish those all might be difficult)
