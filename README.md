FRHD_ULTRA

Update

This  module is usable right now, the procedural generation doesn't require any coding to use (just run it and it will ask you a few questions, do all the code automatically)
However, there is still no documentation
That out of the way

It lets you:
1. Procedurally generate tracks
2. Add text to tracks
3. It also contains an the entire frhd_tools library it is based on, so you can use complex mathematics and code to generate tracks
4. This is not a current use, but I am planning on maybe adding some decoration like trees and clouds that you  can just generate in with a single command (but that is still very far away)

It also lets you create tracks automatically without human interference, so you  can in theory generate a million tracks a day (although getting the coins to publish those all might be difficult)
