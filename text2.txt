The Subspace Emissary's Worlds Conquest

BEFORE ANYONE SAYS SOMETHING BAD ABOUT OCs...

This story only contains a single OC through the whole fic. Don't THINK this OC came out of nowhere because there is a prequel to this fic so my OC and Lucario could be developed (if you want to read it). However, the most important aspects of the two will be briefly shown in here to give you an idea.

Also, it would make much more sense if you read "The Bond of Aura" so you don't get a wrong impression of this OC (Chris). I've taken precautions about the Gary Sues and Mary Sues...

...Well, with that away...

Well, the start of my series begins now with this story. I hope you all enjoy this long story about the struggle of a prolonged fight against the Subspace Army… Basically, this is an "if" version of what would've happened if the Smashers never defeated Tabuu the second time they fought him.

I encourage all Brawl fanatics to read on, enjoy, and review.

Disclaimer: AuraChannelerChris doesn't own anything in this story and future chapters. He only owns his OC.
